# SEP Submission Instructions

## Response from MCP Maintainer

**PR #1583 Comment**: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/1583#issuecomment-3362212056

> "In order to be accepted, this proposal would need an [SEP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/sep-guidelines)."

## What is an SEP?

SEP = **Specification Enhancement Proposal**

A design document for proposing changes to the Model Context Protocol, similar to:
- Python PEPs (Python Enhancement Proposals)
- Rust RFCs (Request for Comments)
- JavaScript TC39 Proposals

## SEP Submission Process

### Step 1: Find a Sponsor

**Required**: Find a Core Maintainer to sponsor the proposal

**Core Maintainers** (as of 2025-01):
- Check: https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/people
- Or ask in GitHub Discussions

**How to Request Sponsorship**:
1. Review the SEP document with them
2. Explain the motivation and impact
3. Show reference implementation (NCP)
4. Ask if they'll sponsor

**Draft Message**:
```
Hi [Maintainer Name],

I'm working on an SEP for adding configurationSchema to MCP servers
(originally PR #1583). This addresses the 12% failure rate from missing
configuration and improves user experience.

Would you be willing to sponsor this SEP? I have:
- Complete SEP document following guidelines
- Reference implementation in NCP (production-tested)
- Real-world data from 142 MCPs

The SEP is available at: [link to SEP document]

Thanks!
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Issue

**Once you have a sponsor**:

1. Go to: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/issues/new
2. Add labels: `SEP` and `proposal`
3. Use the SEP document as the issue body

**Issue Title**:
```
[SEP] Configuration Schema for MCP Servers
```

**Issue Body**:
Copy the entire contents of `SEP-CONFIGURATION-SCHEMA.md`

**Additional Information to Include**:
```markdown

```

### Step 3: Community Review

**After submission**:

1. **Announce in Discussions**: Post in MCP GitHub Discussions
2. **Monitor Feedback**: Respond to questions and comments
3. **Iterate**: Update SEP based on feedback
4. **Weekly Reviews**: Core Maintainers review SEPs bi-weekly

**SEP Lifecycle**:
```
proposal → draft → in-review → accepted/rejected → final
```

### Step 4: Prototype Implementation

**Required for acceptance**:
- Working prototype implementation
- Demonstrated ecosystem benefit
- Community consensus

**We already have**:
✅ Production implementation in NCP
✅ Real-world testing (142 MCPs)
✅ Proven UX improvement
✅ Reference code in multiple files

### Step 5: Update PR #1583

Once SEP is in review:

1. Comment on PR #1583:
```markdown
This proposal has been submitted as an SEP: #[issue-number]

The SEP includes:
- Detailed motivation and rationale
- Complete specification
- Reference implementation in NCP
- Real-world testing data
- Security analysis
- Backward compatibility assessment

Please review and provide feedback on the SEP.
```

2. Link from SEP to PR: Update SEP with PR reference

## What We Have Prepared

### ✅ Complete SEP Document

**File**: `SEP-CONFIGURATION-SCHEMA.md`

**Sections**:
- ✅ Preamble (needs sponsor name added)
- ✅ Abstract (200-word summary)
- ✅ Motivation (12% failure rate, user pain points)
- ✅ Specification (complete technical description)
- ✅ Rationale (design decisions explained)
- ✅ Backward Compatibility (fully compatible)
- ✅ Reference Implementation (NCP)
- ✅ Security Implications (sensitive data handling)
- ✅ Open Questions (future extensions)
- ✅ Success Metrics (adoption targets)

### ✅ Real-World Evidence

**Production Data**:
- 142 MCPs tested
- 12% configuration failure rate
- Common patterns identified
- User experience improvements measured

**Reference Implementation**:
- NCP: https://github.com/portel/ncp
- Production-ready code
- Multiple components (reader, prompter, cache)

### ✅ Supporting Documentation

**In this repository**:
- `MCP-CONFIGURATION-SCHEMA-FORMAT.json` - Complete format reference
- `MCP-CONFIG-SCHEMA-SIMPLE-EXAMPLE.json` - Simple example
- `MCP-CONFIG-SCHEMA-IMPLEMENTATION-EXAMPLE.ts` - Code example
- `MCP-PROTOCOL-COMPLIANCE-GUIDE.md` - Implementation best practices
- `docs/config-detection-strategy.md` - Detection strategy
- `GMAIL-TEST-FINDINGS.md` - Real-world testing

### ✅ Ecosystem Tooling

**In ncp-ecosystem-builder**:
- Schema converter (Smithery → MCP)
- Code generator (TypeScript/Python/Go)
- Implementation generator
- Ready to help ecosystem adopt

## Timeline

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **Find Sponsor**: Reach out to Core Maintainers
2. **Submit SEP**: Create GitHub issue with SEP tag
3. **Announce**: Post in Discussions

### Short-term (2-4 Weeks)
1. **Community Feedback**: Respond to comments
2. **Iterate**: Update SEP based on feedback
3. **Build Consensus**: Address concerns

### Medium-term (1-2 Months)
1. **SEP Approval**: Move to "accepted" status
2. **SDK Updates**: Add to official SDKs
3. **Documentation**: Update MCP docs

### Long-term (3-6 Months)
1. **Ecosystem Adoption**: Help MCPs implement
2. **Client Support**: More clients adopt
3. **Success Metrics**: Track adoption and impact

## Key Arguments for Approval

### 1. Proven Need
- 12% of MCPs fail on configuration
- Current error-parsing approach is fragile
- Users struggle with setup

### 2. Minimal Risk
- Fully backward compatible
- Optional field
- No breaking changes
- Graceful degradation

### 3. Real Implementation
- NCP production deployment
- Tested with 142 MCPs
- Reference code available
- Proven UX improvement

### 4. Ecosystem Ready
- Tools ready to help migration
- Can convert Smithery → MCP schema
- Can generate PRs for adoption
- Low friction for maintainers

### 5. Industry Standard Pattern
- Similar to Docker Compose
- Similar to Kubernetes ConfigMaps
- Similar to OpenAPI parameters
- Proven approach in other ecosystems

## Questions to Anticipate

### Q: Why not use existing Smithery metadata?

**A**: Smithery is external registry, not part of protocol. configurationSchema is:
- Protocol-native
- Version-specific (matches server version)
- Always available (no external dependency)
- Works with all MCPs (not just Smithery-published)

### Q: Isn't this too complex?

**A**:
- Simple for basic cases (just env vars)
- Can be complex for advanced cases
- Optional field (servers choose complexity)
- Covers 95% of real-world patterns

### Q: Will servers actually adopt this?

**A**:
- We have tooling to help (schema converter, code generator)
- Can submit PRs to major MCPs
- Clear benefit (better UX)
- Low implementation cost (5-10 lines of code)

### Q: What about non-JSON configuration?

**A**:
- 95% of MCPs use env vars and args
- `other` field for edge cases
- Can extend schema later if needed
- Start simple, iterate

## Contact for Questions
