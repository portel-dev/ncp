# Conversation Export Handling

## Important: Do NOT Delete Conversation Exports!

When conversation exports (`.txt` files) appear in the root directory:

### ❌ DON'T:
- Delete them (we lose valuable data!)
- Commit them to OSS repo (clutters repository)

### ✅ DO:
- Move them to the commercial repository: `~/Projects/ncp/`

## Quick Command:

```bash
# Move any conversation export to commercial repo
mv 2025-*.txt ~/Projects/ncp/
```

## Why?

The commercial NCP repository (`~/Projects/ncp/`) is where we keep:
- All conversation histories
- Development documentation
- Internal notes and research

This preserves the data while keeping the OSS repo clean.

## Current Commercial Repo Exports:

See: `~/Projects/ncp/*.txt`
