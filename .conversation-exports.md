# Conversation Export Handling

## âœ¨ Fully Automated (Git Pre-Commit Hook)

Conversation exports and other `.txt` files in the root are **automatically moved** to the commercial repository before any commit!

### How It Works:

When you run `git commit`, the pre-commit hook:

1. âœ… Detects any `.txt` files in the root directory
2. âœ… Automatically moves them to `~/Projects/ncp/` (commercial repo)
3. âœ… Shows confirmation message
4. âœ… Proceeds with commit (or aborts if no changes remain)

**Example output:**
```
ðŸ“¦ Auto-moving conversation export: 2025-10-15-improvements.txt â†’ ~/Projects/ncp/
   âœ… Moved to commercial repo (data preserved)
```

### Manual Move (If Needed):

If you need to move files manually (e.g., when not committing):

```bash
mv 2025-*.txt ~/Projects/ncp/
```

## Why?

The commercial NCP repository (`~/Projects/ncp/`) is where we keep:
- All conversation histories
- Development documentation
- Internal notes and research

This preserves all data while keeping the OSS repo clean.

## Whitelisted Files:

These `.txt` files are **not** auto-moved (they belong in OSS repo):
- `LICENSE.txt`
- `README.txt`
- `CHANGELOG.txt`

## Current Commercial Repo Exports:

See: `~/Projects/ncp/*.txt` (50+ conversation exports preserved)
