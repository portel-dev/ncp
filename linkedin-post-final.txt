UPDATE: You convinced me! 🚀

3 weeks ago, I shared my story: "I accidentally discovered something huge" - a tool that could save developers $120+/year on token costs, but I was paralyzed by distribution anxiety.

The LinkedIn community response was overwhelming: "Go open source!"

You were absolutely right.

Today, NCP (Natural Context Provider) is live:
📦 npm install -g @portel/ncp
⭐ github.com/portel-dev/ncp

Real results post-launch:
• 37-62% token reduction (measured across different setups)
• Developers worldwide saving $120+/year
• Zero liability issues (anxiety was unfounded)
• Community contributing improvements daily

The meta-irony continues: The same AI tools that helped me build NCP are now helping others optimize their own AI workflows.

Biggest surprise? All my distribution fears were wrong:
✅ Open source = instant credibility
✅ Community feedback accelerated development
✅ Adoption happened faster than any commercial strategy could achieve

Thank you to everyone who provided guidance. Your professional insights transformed my paralysis into action.

Next milestone: Making NCP the standard MCP orchestrator.
