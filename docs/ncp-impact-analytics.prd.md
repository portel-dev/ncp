# PRD: NCP Impact Analytics

## Overview

NCP Impact Analytics is a comprehensive analytics system that transforms raw MCP usage logs into actionable insights, demonstrating the real-world impact and value of NCP's N-to-1 MCP Orchestration. This feature provides users with beautiful dashboards, performance metrics, and quantified business value from their NCP usage.

## Problem Statement

Users of NCP have no visibility into:
