# Test Implementation Status Report

**Date**: October 25, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **COMMAND VALIDATION TESTS COMPLETE & PASSING**

## Executive Summary

We have successfully implemented and deployed **26 passing unit tests** for command injection validation, the most critical security feature added in this release. The remaining test stubs are documented and ready for future implementation.

## ✅ Completed: Command Injection Validation Tests

### File: `tests/command-validation.test.ts`

**Status**: ✅ All 26 tests passing
**Coverage**: Comprehensive command injection vector testing
**Execution Time**: 0.916 seconds

#### Test Categories

1. **Safe Command Acceptance** (8 tests)
   - Single-word commands (node, npx, python, docker)
   - Absolute paths
   - Complex safe arguments
   - Hyphens, underscores, slashes
   - Unicode characters
   - Very long arguments (1000+ chars)

2. **Dangerous Shell Metacharacter Blocking** (7 tests)
   - Semicolon (`;`) command chaining
   - Pipe (`|`) for output redirection
   - Ampersand (`&&`) for sequential commands
   - Backticks (`` ` ``) for command substitution
   - Dollar-parenthesis `$(...)` for substitution
   - Input/output redirection (`<`, `>`)

3. **Argument-Level Protection** (5 tests)
   - Shell metacharacters in arguments
   - Command substitution attempts
   - Shell pipes in arguments
   - Path traversal arguments

4. **Malicious Payload Attempts** (4 tests)
   - RCE via command substitution
   - File manipulation attempts
   - Data exfiltration attempts
   - Command chaining prevention

### Test Results
```
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       26 passed, 26 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.916 s
```

### Security Coverage

The tests validate protection against:
- **Shell Injection**: All shell metacharacters blocked
- **Command Injection**: Command substitution prevented
- **Path Traversal**: `../` sequences blocked
- **Type Validation**: Non-string arguments rejected
- **Complex Payloads**: Multi-vector attacks detected

## 📋 Test Stubs: Ready for Future Implementation

### 1. Profile Manager Auto-Import Tests
**File**: `tests/profile-manager-autoimport.test.ts` (370 lines)
**Status**: 📋 Stub - Ready for refactoring

**Test Coverage Plan**:
- Parallel import execution (5+ MCPs)
- 30-second timeout enforcement
- Deduplication of existing MCPs
- Error handling for partial failures
- Skip flag behavior

**Why Stubbed**: Integration tests with ProfileManager require proper mocking of async operations and file I/O, which adds complexity. Best implemented with dedicated integration test framework.

### 2. OAuth Device Flow Cleanup Tests
**File**: `tests/oauth-device-flow.test.ts` (410 lines)
**Status**: 📋 Stub - Ready for refactoring

**Test Coverage Plan**:
- stdin listener cleanup on success
- stdin state restoration on error
- Non-TTY environment handling
- Timeout behavior
- Ctrl+C cancellation handling

**Why Stubbed**: Requires mocking process.stdin with complex state management. Can be implemented with process mocking libraries.

### 3. Connection Pool Tests
**File**: `tests/ncp-orchestrator-pool.test.ts` (320 lines)
**Status**: 📋 Stub - Ready for refactoring

**Test Coverage Plan**:
- MAX_CONNECTIONS limit (50)
- MAX_EXECUTIONS_PER_CONNECTION limit (1000)
- LRU eviction algorithm
- Connection reuse tracking
- Disconnection handling

**Why Stubbed**: Requires access to orchestrator's private connection map. Can be implemented through protected test methods.

### 4. Find/Add Integration Tests
**File**: `tests/find-add-integration.test.ts` (450 lines)
**Status**: 📋 Stub - Ready for refactoring

**Test Coverage Plan**:
- Zero-results showing registry MCPs
- Tools list returned after add
- End-to-end workflow (find → add → use)
- HTTP/SSE MCP support
- Error handling and timeouts

**Why Stubbed**: Requires full MCP server initialization and tool execution. Best as end-to-end test.
