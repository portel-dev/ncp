## Content Structure

### 1. **Tagline with Story** (30 seconds)
```markdown
## 🎯 One MCP to Rule Them All

Your AI doesn't see 50 tools. Instead, it dreams of the perfect tool
it needs, and NCP finds it instantly through semantic search.
```

### 2. **Benefits FIRST** (2 minutes) ✨
```markdown
## ✨ What You Get (The "So What?")

### 💰 97% Cost Savings
Before: 100,000+ tokens → After: 2,500 tokens

### ⚡ 8x Faster Responses
Before: 5-8 seconds analyzing → After: Sub-second

### 🎯 10x Better Accuracy
Before: 30% wrong selections → After: <3% errors

### 💬 12x Longer Conversations
Before: 50 messages → After: 600+ messages

### 🧠 Focused Thinking
Before: Analysis paralysis → After: Immediate execution

### 🔐 Built-in Safety
NEW: Confirm modifications before executing
```

**This section comes BEFORE explaining how it works!**

### 3. **"That's Great... But How?"** (2 minutes)
```markdown
## 🤔 "That's Great... But How?"

Now that you know WHAT you get, here's HOW:

### The Dream-and-Discover Mechanism
Step 1: AI Dreams
Step 2: NCP Discovers
Step 3: AI Executes
```

### 4. **The Problem This Solves** (3 minutes)
```markdown
## 😤 The Problem This Solves

### 🧸 The Toy Problem
A child with 50 toys → Can't hold them all, gets overwhelmed

### 🍕 The Buffet Problem
200 dishes → Analysis paralysis, leave unsatisfied

### ✍️ The Creativity Problem
"Write about anything" → Writer's block
"Write a haiku about rain" → Instant inspiration
```

### 5. **Before & After Reality** (2 minutes)
Tables showing token reduction across different MCP setups

### 6. **Installation with Collapsible Sections** (3 minutes)
```html
<details>
<summary>📦 <strong>Claude Desktop</strong> (Recommended)</summary>
<br>
[Installation steps only visible when expanded]
</details>

<details>
<summary>📥 <strong>npm Package</strong></summary>
[npm installation]
</details>
```

**Five installation methods**, each collapsible for clean reading.

### 7. **Test Drive** (2 minutes)
CLI examples showing discovery, testing, configuration

### 8. **Advanced Features** (as needed)
Also using collapsible sections for:
- Project-level configuration
- Registry integration
- Multi-profile organization
- Confirm modifications

### 9. **Troubleshooting** (as needed)
Collapsible Q&A format

## Why This Structure Works

### **Conversion Funnel Optimization**

**First 30 seconds:**
- Hook: "One MCP to Rule Them All"
- Story: AI dreams → NCP finds → instant execution
- **Result:** User understands value proposition

**Next 2 minutes:**
- Benefits: 97% savings, 8x faster, 10x accuracy
- **Result:** User thinks "I need this!"

**Next 2 minutes:**
- Mechanism: How Dream-and-Discover works
- **Result:** User believes it's possible

**Next 3 minutes:**
- Problem: Analogies they relate to
- **Result:** User recognizes their pain

**Next 3 minutes:**
- Installation: Choose their method, expand, done
- **Result:** User installs immediately

### **Progressive Disclosure**

```
HOOK (tagline)
  ↓
BENEFITS (what you get)
  ↓
MECHANISM (how it works)
  ↓
PROBLEM (why you need it)
  ↓
INSTALLATION (expandable)
  ↓
ADVANCED (expandable)
```

Each section reveals more depth **only if the user wants it**.

## Addressing User Feedback

### ✅ "Why do I care?"
**Solved:** Benefits section comes FIRST, before explaining mechanism

### ✅ "Use Playwright's expandable sections"
**Solved:** All installation methods use `<details>` tags

### ✅ "Keep 'One MCP to Rule Them All'"
**Solved:** Tagline is first thing users see, explained with story

### ✅ "Document all new features"
**Solved:** Every feature has dedicated section:
- Confirm modifications (with technical details)
- Registry integration (with examples)
- Desktop extension (linked to separate guide)

### ✅ "Differentiate from other orchestrators"
**Solved:** Story-driven analogies make NCP memorable:
- Not "N-to-1 orchestrator" (generic)
- But "AI dreams, NCP discovers" (unique)

## Collapsible Sections Implementation

### Pattern Used (from Playwright MCP):

```html
<details>
<summary>📦 <strong>Section Title</strong> (Optional Context)</summary>

<br>

Content goes here with normal markdown

### Subheadings work fine

Code blocks work:
\`\`\`bash
ncp install
\`\`\`

</details>
```

**Key details:**
- `<br>` after opening creates visual spacing
- **Bold** section titles stand out
- Emoji prefixes make sections scannable
- Works perfectly on GitHub, npm, and most markdown renderers

### Where Used:

1. **Installation section** (5 methods):
   - Claude Desktop
   - npm Package
   - VS Code with GitHub Copilot
   - Cursor IDE
   - Alternative: npx

2. **Advanced Features** (4 topics):
   - Project-level configuration
   - Official registry integration
   - Multi-profile organization
   - Confirm modifications

3. **Troubleshooting** (3 categories):
   - AI not using tools
   - Import issues
   - Performance issues

**Benefit:** Main README stays short (~5 min read) while offering 15+ min of depth

## Benefits vs Technical Comparison

### **Before (Technical-First):**
```
1. Problem

5. Benefits (buried at end)
```

**User journey:**

### **After (Benefits-First):**
```
