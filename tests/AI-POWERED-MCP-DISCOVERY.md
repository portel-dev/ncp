# AI-Powered MCP Discovery

## 🎯 The Better Approach

**You're absolutely right!** We don't need to wait for the registry. We can discover MCP servers in real-time:

1. **AI searches web** → Finds potential MCP endpoints
2. **Validate URL** → Test if it speaks MCP protocol
3. **Auto-discover** → Find tools and auth requirements
4. **Import** → Add to NCP automatically

---

## 🤖 AI Discovery Workflow

### Step 1: Search for MCP Endpoints

**User asks AI:**
```
"Search the web for public MCP servers that support HTTP or SSE"
"Find MCP APIs that I can connect to remotely"
"Are there any hosted MCP services available?"
```

**AI uses web search to find:**
- Blog posts announcing MCP endpoints
- GitHub repos with MCP server URLs
- Company APIs with MCP support
- Developer documentation mentioning MCP

**Example findings:**
```
Found in article: "We're launching MCP support at https://api.example.com/mcp"
Found in GitHub README: SSE endpoint available at https://mcp.service.com/sse
Found in docs: Connect to our MCP at https://api.company.com/v1/mcp
```

### Step 2: Validate Each URL

**AI uses validation tool:**
```bash
node tests/validate-mcp-url.js https://api.example.com/mcp
```

**Tool checks:**
1. ✅ Can connect to URL?
2. ✅ Responds to MCP protocol?
3. ✅ Returns tools list?
4. ✅ Valid server info?

**If YES** → It's a real MCP!
**If NO** → Skip it

### Step 3: Auto-Discover Configuration

**For each valid MCP:**
```
1. Detect auth type (bearer, oauth, apiKey, none)
2. List available tools
3. Get server capabilities
4. Generate import config
```

### Step 4: Build Import CSV

**AI generates:**
```csv
name,url,description
example-api,https://api.example.com/mcp,Example MCP Service
company-mcp,https://api.company.com/v1/mcp,Company MCP API
service-mcp,https://mcp.service.com/sse,Service MCP (SSE)
```

### Step 5: Batch Import

**User runs:**
```bash
node tests/batch-import-mcps.js ai-discovered-mcps.csv --profile discovered
```

Or **AI imports directly** using internal tools!

## 🚀 Complete AI Workflow Example

### User Conversation

```
User: "Find me some HTTP/SSE MCP servers I can connect to"

AI: *Searches web*
    Found 3 potential MCP endpoints:
    1. https://api.example.com/mcp (from blog post)
    2. https://mcp.service.com/sse (from GitHub)
    3. https://api.test.com/v1/mcp (from docs)

    Let me validate these...

AI: *Runs validation tool on each*

    ✅ https://api.example.com/mcp
       • Valid MCP server
       • 5 tools available
       • Requires: Bearer token

    ✅ https://mcp.service.com/sse
       • Valid MCP server
       • 8 tools available
       • Requires: API key

    ❌ https://api.test.com/v1/mcp
       • Not responding / Not an MCP server

User: "Great! Add both valid ones to my profile"

AI: *For each server*
    1. Shows confirm_add_mcp prompt
    2. User copies credentials to clipboard
    3. AI imports using ncp:add

    ✅ Added example-api (bearer auth)
    ✅ Added service-mcp (api key auth)

User: "List my MCPs"

AI: Shows configured MCPs with URLs and auth types
```

## 🛠️ Tools Created

### 1. URL Validator (`validate-mcp-url.js`)

**Usage:**
```bash
node tests/validate-mcp-url.js <url>
```

**Features:**
- Detects auth requirements
- Attempts MCP protocol connection
- Lists tools if successful
- Reports capabilities
- Suggests import config

**Example:**
```bash
$ node tests/validate-mcp-url.js https://api.example.com/mcp

🔍 Validating MCP URL
URL: https://api.example.com/mcp

Step 1: Detecting authentication requirements...
🔐 Requires: bearer

Step 2: Attempting MCP protocol connection...
✅ Connected via MCP protocol

Server Info:
   Name: example-mcp
   Version: 1.0.0

✅ Found 5 tools:
   • search_api
     Search the API database
   • get_data
     Retrieve specific data
   ...

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 Validation Report

✅ VALID MCP SERVER

Summary:
   URL: https://api.example.com/mcp
   Auth Type: bearer
   MCP Protocol: Supported
   Server: example-mcp v1.0.0
   Tools: 5

⚠️  Requires Authentication

Auth Requirements:
   Type: bearer
   • Bearer Token (required)
     Enter your API bearer token
```

### 2. Batch Import (`batch-import-mcps.js`)

Already created! Processes CSV of URLs with auto-discovery.

### 3. AI Integration

**Internal MCP can:**
1. Call web search (if available)
2. Validate URLs using subprocess
3. Import directly using ncp:add

## 🎯 Why This is Better Than Waiting

### Registry Limitations
- ❌ Only contains submitted servers
- ❌ Requires manual submission process
- ❌ May lag behind actual deployments
- ❌ Not all companies will submit

### AI Discovery Advantages
- ✅ Finds servers as they're announced
- ✅ Discovers from blogs, docs, READMEs
- ✅ Validates in real-time
- ✅ No waiting for registry
- ✅ Can find private/unlisted MCPs

## 📋 Immediate Action Plan

### For Users

**Option 1: Manual Search + Validation**
```bash
# 1. Find a potential MCP URL (web search)
# 2. Validate it
node tests/validate-mcp-url.js <url>

# 3. If valid, add to CSV
echo "name,url,description" > found-mcps.csv
echo "my-mcp,<url>,Description" >> found-mcps.csv

# 4. Import
node tests/batch-import-mcps.js found-mcps.csv
```

**Option 2: Ask AI**
```
"Search for MCP servers and add valid ones to my profile"
```

AI will:
1. Search web
2. Validate URLs
3. Import automatically

### For Developers

**If you're hosting an MCP:**
1. Announce your URL publicly (blog, docs, GitHub)
2. AI will find it
3. Users can discover and import automatically

**No registry submission needed!**

---

## 🔍 Search Queries That Work

AI can search for:
- "MCP HTTP endpoint"
- "MCP SSE server URL"
- "Model Context Protocol API"
- "MCP remote server"
- "[Company] MCP support"
- "MCP as a service"

Then validate each URL found!
