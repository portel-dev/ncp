# Testing Results

## Automated Tests - ✅ PASSED

Ran: `./test/run-integration-tests.sh`

Results:
- ✓ ncp command available
- ✓ Test MCP server found
- ✓ ncp list works
- ✓ Added MCP without schema
- ✓ MCP appears in ncp list
- ℹ ncp find test skipped (slow with many MCPs)
- ✓ Discovery failure handled gracefully

**Total**: 6/6 tests passed

## Manual Schema Testing

### Test 1: MCP Server Validation
**Command**: `node test/mcp-with-schema.js`
**Result**: ✅ Server starts correctly
**Evidence**: Warning message shows: "[WARN] TEST_TOKEN not provided - some features may not work"

### Test 2: Schema Detection (Interactive)
**Command**: `ncp add test-schema node test/mcp-with-schema.js`
**Status**: Ready for manual testing

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Discovery shows: "🔍 Discovering tools and configuration requirements..."
2. Message shows: "📋 Configuration required"
3. Prompt appears: "Enter TEST_TOKEN:"
4. Input is masked (password-style)
5. Success message: "✓ Configuration schema cached"
6. MCP added to profile with TEST_TOKEN in env

**How to Test**:
```bash
# Run the add command
ncp add test-schema node test/mcp-with-schema.js

# When prompted for TEST_TOKEN, enter:
test_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456

# Verify it was cached
cat ~/.ncp/cache/schemas/test-schema.schema.json | jq .

# Verify it works
ncp run test-schema get_config '{}'
```
